In this project I continue working on the JavaQuizGame, but here I am using Spring and SpringBoot instead of EJB and Docker.

This Quiz Game make use of Spring Security and enable players to log in or sign up if
they do not yet have registered.

The game hold track of how many times a player have won or lost a game. It is doing this by using sessions.

In the end this is going to be hosted on a server online.
